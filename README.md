# Password Generator

## Description
Project to build a password generator that runs in the browser, powered by JavaScript. This generator allows a completely random password to be produced, with options for upper and lower case characters, special characters and numeric characters. The generator also allows for password length to be inputted between 8 and 128 characters. These options mean password requirements can easily be inputted to produce an instant random password

HTML and CSS starter code was provided, along with JavaScript character arrays. I wrote code within three main functions to build the password generator

During this project I developed my knowledge of creating functions and using built-in methods and arrays. I also practised combining these tools to create the desired effect, while also refactoring to produce clean, readable code.  I carried out research to find the most appropriate tools to use for this purpose


## Installation

N/A

## Usage
